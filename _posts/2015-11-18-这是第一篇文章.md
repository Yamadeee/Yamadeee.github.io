Markdown's syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a
format for *writing* for the web.

Markdown is not a <a href="/blog" class="a-purple">replacement for HTML</a>, or even close to it. Its
syntax is very small, corresponding only to a very small subset of
HTML tags. The idea is 阿萨德飞洒李靖阿斯蒂芬了write, and
edit prose. HTML is a *publishing* format; Markdown is a *writing*
format. Thus, <a href="/blog" class="a-green">Markdown's formatting syntax</a> only addresses issues that
can be conveyed in plain text.

For any markup that is not covered by Markdown's syntax, you simply
use HTML itself. There's no need to preface it or delimit it to
indicate that you're switching from Markdown to HTML; you just use
the tags.

The only restrictions are that block-level HTML elements -- e.g. `<div>`,
`<table>`, `<pre>`, `<p>`, etc. -- must be separated from surrounding
content by blank lines, and the start and end tags of the block should
not be indented with tabs or spaces. Markdown is smart enough not
to add extra (unwanted) `<p>` tags around HTML block-level tags.
